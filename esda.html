        <h2>Disadvantages of Embedded System</h2>
        <p>	Once configured, these systems cannot be changed. Hence, no improvement or up gradation on the ones designed and created can be made. <br>
            	They are hard to maintain. It is also difficult to take a back-up of embedded files. <br>
            	Troubleshooting is difficult for embedded systems. Transferring data from one system to another is also quite problematic. <br>
            	Because these systems are made for specific tasks, hardware is limited.
