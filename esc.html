        <h2>Characteristics of Embedded System</h2>
        <p> 	<strong>Single-functioned</strong> : an embedded system usually performs a specialized operation and does the same repeatedly. For example: A pager always functions as a pager. <br>
            <strong>Tightly constrained</strong> : All computing systems have constraints on design metrics, but those on an embedded system can be especially tight. Design metrics is a measure of an implementation's features such as its cost, size, power, and performance. It must be of a size to fit on a single chip, must perform fast enough to process data in real time and consume minimum power to extend battery life. <br>
            <strong>Reactive and Real time</strong> : Many embedded systems must continually react to changes in the system's environment and must compute certain results in real time without any delay. Consider an example of a car cruise controller; it continually monitors and reacts to speed and brake sensors. It must compute acceleration or de-accelerations repeatedly within a limited time; a delayed computation can result in failure to control of the car. <br>
            <strong>Microprocessors based</strong> : It must be microprocessor or microcontroller based. <br>
            <strong>Memory</strong> : It must have a memory, as its software usually embeds in ROM. It does not need any secondary memories in the computer. <br>
            <strong>Connected</strong> : It must have connected peripherals to connect input and output devices. <br>
            <strong>HW-SW systems</strong> : Software is used for more features and flexibility. Hardware is used for performance and security.
