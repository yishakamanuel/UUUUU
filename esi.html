        <h2>Introduction of Embedded System</h2>
        <p>An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with a computer, hidden inside, to perform a single dedicated purpose. There are more computers on this planet than there are people, and most of these computers are single-chip microcontrollers that are the brains of an embedded system. 
            Embedded systems are a ubiquitous component of our everyday lives. We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges, our toys, and our work. As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. Therefore the world needs a trained workforce to develop and manage products based on embedded microcontrollers.
